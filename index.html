          <h2>Story Board Signs</h2>
          <p>The following are signs for a story-board experiment
            I'm doing at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland. The intent is to
            tell a story by slowly flipping through these signs in a
            high-foot-traffic location, ostensibly, on the sidewalk in
            front of the main entrance to EvergreenHealth.</p>

          <p>I want to share information on non-therapeutic forced
            genital cutting without immediately provoking a defensive
            reaction on the part of the people receiving the
            presentation.</p>

          <p>I also want to offer people caught up in this issue a
            way out, lest they simply continue to defend the
            indefensible.</p>

          <h3>First production run - six signs</h3>
          <p>To get the best price on signs, I need to do six in a
            run. This is my first set of six signs. I have reduced
            the font size a bit to get more text per sign.</p>
          <p>I'm looking forward to seeing how these signs work in
          real life, and will iterate based on what I learn.</p>
