          <h2>Story Board Signs</h2>
          <p>The following are signs for a story-board experiment
            I'm doing at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland. The intent is to
            tell a story by slowly flipping through these signs in a
            high-foot-traffic location, ostensibly, on the sidewalk in
            front of the main entrance to EvergreenHealth.</p>

          <p>I want to share information on non-therapeutic forced
            genital cutting in an engaging, non-threatening way.</p>

          <p>My hope is to create a space where people who have made
            mistakes on this issue can move to, now or in the future,
            as against staying rooted in their current position. In
            my view, if we do not offer people a way out, they will
            defend the positions that allow non-therapeutic circumcision
            to exist and to propagate.</p>

          <h3>First production run - six signs</h3>
          <p>To get the best price on signs, I need to do six in a
            run. This is my first set of six signs. I have reduced
            the font size a bit to get more text per sign.</p>
          <p>I'm looking forward to seeing how these signs work in
          real life, and will iterate based on what I learn.</p>

          <h3>Second production run - six signs</h3>
          <p>These are some signs I made up over the weekend. I
            think I'm going to wind up with a fairly large set of
            signs over time. I need to go slow and see which ones
            lead to the best conversations.</p>
